# sbd
Simple Bibliography Database

## Introduction

This tool manages article PDFs.  This tool is based on two working principles.
First, DOIs are central. Only documents with a DOI can be stored in the
database. All metadata is acquired through the [Crossref](https://crossref.org)
[API](https://github.com/CrossRef/rest-api-doc) through DOIs scraped from the
PDF or entered by the user. Second, document repositories are local to a
directory hierarchy. For example, if I have a project based in ~/projects/foo,
I can create a document repository by 

    cd ~/projects/foo
    sbd init

This creates a new direcory in ~/projects/foo called articles. All PDFs
imported into the database will be copied here. Running `sbd` in
~/projects/foo, or any directory below it will use the repository at
~/projects/foo/articles.
